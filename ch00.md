# Programming Well

Good code is clear and well-documented, and it tries to package tasks into modules.

This guide is not a how-to or a recipe book (the Internet abounds with such resources). Rather, we hope that you gain some programming skills.

Programs are written once and read many times. Each time part of a program is modified, a larger part of the progam needs to be read again.

The goal here is not portability, but how to write robust code that are easy to troubleshoot when unanticipated problems arise.

There are many ways to achieve the same output. Choose the clearest one that is reasonably efficient.

Bash is purported to be an easy programming language to learn, but has been a source of frustration for me when I first learned it. Hopefully, this guide will help you start off right.
