# Streaming Data through Pipes

Linux programs, irrespectively they are compiled, Bash scripts, or scripts written in another language, receive several inputs and sends several outputs. As shown in the previous chapter, programs receive **command-line arguments** and inherit **environment variables** from their parent processes. Aside from reading input files, they can also read from the **standard input**, or `stdin`. Additionally, they can also receive signals such as *terminate* (from `kill`) or *interrupt* (from `C-c`). For outputs, programs report their exit status (by updating `$?` upon exit), write to output files, and print to **standard output**, or `stdout`. Additionally, programs can also print to **standard error**, or `stderr`.

Standard input is what the user enters at the terminal when a program prompts
for user input. Standard output is what is output to and displayed on the terminal. Standard error is also displayed on the terminal by default, but this data stream is different from standard output.

We will use the following programs in this chapter:

Command       | Use
------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------
`head`        | Print the first part of files.
`tail`        | Print the last part of files.
`wc`          | Count lines, words, and bytes.
`tr`          | Translate characters.
`sort`        | Sort lines of text.
`shuffle`     | Shuffle lines of text.
`comm`        | Compare two sorted files line by line.
`uniq`        | Report unique lines in a file.
`cut`         | Cut out a column of a table.
`paste`       | Paste lines from files side by side.
`join`        | Joine two tables on a common field.
